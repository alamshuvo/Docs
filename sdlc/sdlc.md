# what is software 
- software is  more than just a program code . A program is an excutable code ,which serves some computational purpose. Software is considered to be a collection of executable programming code ,
associated libraries and documentations software, when made for a specific requirement .
# why Software Engineering 
- without using software engineering principles it would be diffuclt to develop large programs 
- Complexity and diffculty levels of the programs increase exponentially with their sizes 
- software engineering principles use two important tecniques to reduce problem complexity 
  1. Abstraction 
  2. Decomposition 

  # Software Development Life Cycle Model 
  - A software life cycle model (also called proces model )is a descriptive and diagrammatic representation of the sotware life cycle 
  - it represents all the activities required to make a software product transit through its life cycle phases 
  # Different Life Cycle Models 
  - Classical waterfall Model 
  - iterative waterfall Model
